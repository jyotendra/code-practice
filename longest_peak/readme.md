The elements in an array:
1. adjacent integers are strictly increasing, until they reach the highest number.
2. after the highest peak they strictly decrease.
3. at least 3 integers are required in the peak.


# Possible cases:
## plain first, then increase, then decrease.
1. 1,1,1,1,2,3,4,5,6,4,3,2,1

Steps:
1. Traversal, 
    keep list of traverssed elements separately,
    rising fields
    diminishing fields.
    
2. Peak finder
3. 

## plain decrease first, then increase.
